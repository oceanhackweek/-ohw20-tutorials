    "## File based system organization\n",
    ">In the beginning, there was the command line, compiler and file system. It it was good until it wasn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of *nix, most programs were written in C and compiled at the command line. It didn't take long before it was obvious that organizing files into some type of predictable directory structure made everyone's life a little easier. This led to the \"standard\" (as long as folks generally follow it) of segregating binaries that run and libraries those binaries called upon. In \"classic\" unix, these directories were often placed in the \"user\" directory, /usr:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/usr/\n",
    "    ├── bin\n",
    "    ├── home\n",
    "    ├── lib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "/bin contains runtime programs. /home contained user directories and files. /lib contained any needed libraries to run the programs in /bin and/or programs written by users. You can see remnants of this file structure in all modern *nix base OSs, including MacOS and all variants of Linux. Of course, each distribution does it a little different, but the basic structure is still there. There is an exhaustive history on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package managers\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should we care? Once Linux truly took off in at the turn of the century, different arrangements of the source code broke into separate distributions. Red Hat, Debian, SuSe and others all had their preferred arrangement, often related to where their maintainers had come from (solaris, BSD, Aix, etc). The idea was the same but the names were different. This became a problem when your program was looking for a basic library of functions like *libgcc.a* (or *libgfortran.a*, etc.) If you had some special software installed from a vendor, did those libraries end up in /usr/lib or /usr/superSpecial1.2/lib?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was eventually solved by using package managers at the system level, most prominently *yum* or *apt*, depending upon the type of distro you were using. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then Python arrived and started getting used a lot for system code as well as everyday programming tasks. Lot and lots of additional libraries proliferated and it was, for awhile, a *real* mess, particularly with Red Hat based distributions, since the system python also was used for managing the system, so if a user wanted to use a different, more up-to-date version all kinds of problems might happen if the system needed python1.5 and your were on python2.4. \n",
