# Machine Learning Resources

* Machine Learning with `scikit-learn`:
  *  [Python Data Science Handbook Ch. 6](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.00-machine-learning.html)
  *  also great introduction to Python! 

 
* OHW ML Tutorials from previous years
  *  OHW23 Unsupervised and supervised learning with pellet images: [tutorial](https://oceanhackweek.org/ohw23/tutorials-index/machine-learning.html), [repo](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW23/01-Tue/machine-learning), [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2FgBC6GGBM)
  *  OHW22 Machine Learning Overview: [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JJz0l3GBjYV6W6Bv1L3miny0USaVdJFh4uJEKDtKJ9s/), [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALmCSgpmEzs&t=4s)
  * OHW21 Deep Learning with R: [repo](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW21/deep-learning), [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXDbc5JNyz0&t=242s)
  * OHW19 Machine Learning Whale Call Analysis: [repo](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW22/01-Tue/01-machine-learning-intro/tutorial), [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzd9m18ZrpU&t=3706s) 

* Oceanography Applications:
  * Convolutional Neural Network Classification of Phytoplankton Images: [repo](https://github.com/ifcb-utopia/plankton-CNN-DEMO)
  * U-Net (pixel level prediction) for Chlorophyll Gap Filling: [repo](https://github.com/geo-smart/mind-the-chl-gap/blob/main/notebooks/U-Net_Tutorial.ipynb)
  * SST prediction with ConvLSTM (spatio-temporal model): [repo](https://github.com/SAFS-Varanasi-Internship/2024-tutorials/blob/main/notebooks-ml/ConvLSTM_Tutorial.ipynb)
 

* General Resources:
  * Computer Vision Task Overview (image classification, segmentation, object detection): [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F0RgaGmoA_QVcmEqfVoovi5rfRYvSq3IstLHrT1j0sg/edit#slide=id.g2ce1d6cca0a_0_329) 
  * Fine Tuning a CNN model: [notebook](https://github.com/valentina-s/TeachingDeepLearning/blob/main/model_tuning_flowers.ipynb)
 
* Computational Resources:
  * [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
    * if GPU's used often can lose access to GPU (not clear for how long), Pro version not helpful
  * [Amazon Sagemaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/):
    * transparent about usage limits, occasionally resources are not available
  * [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
